AniBridge is a media synchronization tool designed to keep your activity synchronized across different media viewing and tracking platforms. With its [mappings database](https://github.com/anibridge/anibridge-mappings) of over 60K entries tailored specifically for anime titles, AniBridge is particularly focused on anime content, however can be expanded to support more with [custom mappings](https://anibridge.eliasbenb.dev/mappings/custom-mappings).
